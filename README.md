# Team Guard

A custom lint plugin for Dart and Flutter that helps teams enforce UI rules by blocking specific widgets/classes and suggesting approved replacements.

## Features

- Integrates with `custom_lint` for live IDE feedback.
- Supports configurable restrictions for both widgets and classes.
- Supports `warning` and `error` severities per rule.
- Provides quick-fix suggestions with replacement names/imports.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK `>=3.0.0 <4.0.0`
- IDE plugin:
  - VS Code: `Custom Lint`
  - Android Studio / IntelliJ: `Custom Lint`

## Installation

Add dependencies to your app's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  team_guard: ^1.0.10
```

Then run:

```bash
# Flutter project
flutter pub get

# Dart project
dart pub get
```

`pub get` downloads the package only. It does not auto-configure your project files.

## Setup (Required)

Run one command in your project root:

```bash
dart run team_guard:setup
```

This runs `team_guard:init` first, then starts `custom_lint`.

Manual split (equivalent):

```bash
dart run team_guard:init
```

This command:
- generates `team_guard.yaml` automatically in the project root (if missing)
- creates `analysis_options.yaml` if missing
- adds `custom_lint` plugin under `analyzer.plugins` if missing
- generates missing replacement files in `lib/core` based on `team_guard.yaml`

```bash
dart run custom_lint
```

`custom_lint` is included transitively by `team_guard`, so `dart run custom_lint` is available after `pub get` without adding `custom_lint` manually to your `pubspec.yaml`.

If your IDE still does not show lints, restart analysis server/IDE.

## Configuration

After running `dart run team_guard:init`, you will find `team_guard.yaml` generated in your project root. Edit it as needed:

```yaml
widgets:
  Text:
    replacement: CustomText
    # import: package:your_app/widgets/custom_text.dart
    severity: error

  GestureDetector:
    replacement: AppGestureDetector
    severity: error

classes:
  Colors:
    replacement: AppColors
    # import: package:your_app/theme/app_colors.dart
    severity: error
```

Full setup example: [`example/team_guard_example.dart`](example/team_guard_example.dart)

When you run `dart run team_guard:init`, replacement stubs are created automatically in `lib/core` (for example, `CustomText` -> `lib/core/custom_text.dart`) if the files do not already exist.

### Import Field Format

`import` in `team_guard.yaml` is optional.

- If provided, Team Guard uses it directly for quick-fix auto-import.
- If omitted, Team Guard tries to auto-detect the import from your `lib/` folder when the replacement class exists in exactly one file.

Correct:

```yaml
import: package:your_app/widgets/custom_text.dart
```

or

```yaml
import: "package:your_app/widgets/custom_text.dart"
```

Also accepted:

```yaml
import: "import 'package:your_app/widgets/custom_text.dart';"
```

### Severity Values

- `warning`
- `error`

Use `error` if you want violations to appear as red errors in IDE problems.

## Example Violation

If `Text` is restricted:

```dart
Text('Hello');
```

You will get a lint message suggesting `CustomText` instead.

## Troubleshooting

### Lints appear in terminal but not in IDE

1. Confirm `analysis_options.yaml` contains:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

2. Install IDE plugin `Custom Lint`.
3. Restart analysis:
   - VS Code: `Dart: Restart Analysis Server`
   - Android Studio/IntelliJ: restart IDE
4. Check Problems filter is not set to errors-only if your rules are `warning`.

### `team_guard.yaml` was not generated

- Run `dart run custom_lint` from the project root.
- If still missing, create `team_guard.yaml` manually using the example above.

## To Uninstall

```bash
flutter pub remove team_guard
```
